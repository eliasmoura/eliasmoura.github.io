I am Elias Alves Moura, Brazilian.
I have many interests what I want to talk about in here are the things I learn about technology(programming, embedded systems, electronics) and languages.
Being a Brazilian make me a native Portuguese speaker, but I have interest in learning other languages.
I learned English out of necessity during my graduation in Computer Science and the need to read some documentation/articles in English.
I am gladdy I had to be forced to it as now I can watch/read/listen content in English without much problems.

What I am most interested in programming is low level/system programming, though I do not have much experience on it.
Embedded system is also something that I am hooked into now and want to have a deeper look into it.
Of course, with embedded system came the interest in learn stuff about electronics even if just the basics to be able to put simple circuits together.
