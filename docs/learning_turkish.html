:description: A few thoughts on learning Turkish.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Turkish language or Turkey were things that I never thought of having an
interest of. But after I picked up a good level of knowledge in English and got
myself fascinated with learning a foreign language, I can&#8217;t hold the thought of
how lame it would be knowing just one or two languages. Now, I feel the need to
know other foreign languages and cultures. That might have turned into some kind
of addiction. One that I don&#8217;t mind having.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Being able to watch a video, read a newspaper or book, listen to audio in
English is awesome. Talking with people in English is amazing. Although I barely
do that, it still feels good. At the moment, I can do that in a very small scale
in Turkish.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After I listened to a few Youtube videos in Turkish, I couldn&#8217;t hold myself
but be amazed by the language. It sound incredible and fun. The grammar is
challenging with the agglutinating nature of the language. Appending suffixes
to a word is, however, an interesting characteristic of the language. We have
some of it in Portuguese; for example, when you want to say "little man", you
can just say "homemzinho". That "zinho(a)" suffix creates the meaning of
"little" in Portuguese.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In Turkish, however, the use of suffix are much more complex and bring deep
meanings than what you have in an other language I know of. For example, if you
want to say "I&#8217;m at home" in Turkish, it would be "Evdeyim". Breaking the word
we have:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
ev &#8594; home/house
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
de &#8594; in/at/on
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
(y)im &#8594; I am
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>With this simple example is easy to see how powerful the agglutination of the
Turkish language can be. It is interesting and at the same time very challenging
to non-native speakers. You can easily get yourself frustrated
trying to break down the words to find their roots and suffixes. Leaning
the grammar is by no means easy.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Portuguese was a languages that I hated during all my time in school. When I
started to use it by myself and learn more about other languages, I started to
appreciate my mother tongue. I think I got an appreciation to all languages
after I developed interest in languages. Pronunciation is something I feel
I should be focusing more, but I never do it. Turkish has many friendly
sounds for Brazilian Portuguese speakers. But, that doesn&#8217;t means I can easily
pronounce all the words in Turkish. Learning how to say the <em>ı</em> sound properly
was challenging; I think I am not that good at it still. I try to practice with
a few set of words like <em>kırmızı</em> I also had help with the pronunciation of
those words. A friend recorded a set of words for me and I tried to imitate it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The word that I had most difficult was <em>kırmzı</em>. All those "ı" seemed impossible
for me to pronounce. But with lot of practice and help of my Turkish friends I
managed to pronounce it in an acceptable manner. Although not as fast as I would
hope, I feel like I&#8217;m improving.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I have a lot to learn, but I`m getting somewhere and that makes me happy.</p></div>
